## Overview

WhisperVision is designed to translate lip movements into text, providing a crucial tool for accessibility and communication in noisy environments or for individuals with hearing impairments. The model is trained on a dataset of video clips and employs advanced deep learning techniques to achieve high accuracy.

## Features

- **3D Convolutional Layers:** Extract spatial features from video frames.
- **Bidirectional LSTM Layers:** Capture temporal dependencies in lip movements.
- **TimeDistributed Flattening:** Integrate features over time for better context understanding.
- **Dropout Regularization:** Prevent overfitting and improve generalization.

## Installation

To get started with WhisperVision, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    \`\`\`sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/WhisperVision.git
    cd WhisperVision
    \`\`\`

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
    \`\`\`sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scriptsctivate`
    \`\`\`

3. **Install the dependencies:**
    \`\`\`sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    \`\`\`

## Usage

To use WhisperVision, run the Jupyter Notebook provided in the repository:

1. **Start Jupyter Notebook:**
    \`\`\`sh
    jupyter notebook WhisperVision.ipynb
    \`\`\`

2. **Follow the steps in the notebook** to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate the results.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training WhisperVision consists of various video clips of individuals speaking different phrases. Each video is preprocessed to extract frames and align them with corresponding text annotations.

## Results

The model achieves impressive accuracy in translating lip movements to text. Detailed results, including accuracy metrics and visualizations, can be found in the Jupyter Notebook.
